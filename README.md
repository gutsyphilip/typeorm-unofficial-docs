# Nextra Docs Template 

TypeORM is a great tool, but the docs suck.

Working with it over the past couple of months have made that clear to me. I have no intentions of breaking up with it anytime soon, so I figured I'd spin this up and write better guides for things as I work with them and hopefully leave things better off for the next person.

Cheers!
